# Sentiment_reader

Overview
In this project, we make use of the embedded Watson AI libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. We then deploy the said application over the web using Flask framework.

About Embeddable Watson AI libraries
In this project, I'll be using embeddable libraries to create an AI powered Python application.

Embeddable Watson AI libraries include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library. These libraries can be embedded and distributed as part of your application. 

The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio. The text-to-speech library generates natural sounding audio from written text. All available functions, in each of these libraries, calls pretrained AI models that are all available on the Cloud IDE servers, available to all users for free.

These libraries may also be accessed through your personal systems. The guidelines for the same are available on the Watson AI library page.
